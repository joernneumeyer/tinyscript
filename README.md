# TinyScript
TinyScript (or tisc for short) is a very small scripting language - as the name suggests.
It is a little side project, so I can get a feel how to get going with programming/scripting language design and implementation.

As this project is meant to be used in any production system, it is unlikely that any serious and detailed documentation will be added.
